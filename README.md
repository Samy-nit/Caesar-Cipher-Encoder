This is a simple Python script that encodes plaintext using the Caesar cipher technique.

What is Caesar Cipher?
Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.
